#(SYREEN BASE 1)
 ---- REPORT FROM ORBIT ----

NOT MUCH LEFT OF THIS STARBASE, CAPTAIN. A LOT OF CHARRED REMAINS AND MANGLED METAL... OH? NOW THIS IS INTERESTING CAPTAIN. ACCORDING TO ENSIGN CHARLES, ONE OR TWO OF THE EMERGENCY ESCAPE CAPSULES ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR.

SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE LAUNCHED JUST BEFORE THE KOHR-AH BLASTED THIS PLACE TO KINGDOM COME. SOMEONE COULD HAVE SURVIVED! OR... THE PODS WERE COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED...

LET'S HOPE IT'S THE FIRST THING, HUH?
