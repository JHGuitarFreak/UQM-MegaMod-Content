     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

WE HAVE FINALLY TRAPPED THE HIDEOUS BEAST WHICH HAS BEEN SO HARD TO CAPTURE THESE PAST FEW DAYS.

I SWEAR, WE EMPTIED OUR STUN BATTERIES INTO THAT THING OVER A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE IT EVEN SLOWED DOWN. A FEW MORE SHOTS TO ITS BARBED HEAD, AND IT WENT DOWN, BUT WE HAD ONLY A FEW SECONDS TO GET IT INTO THE MAGNETIC RESTRAITS BEFORE IT STARTED THRASHING AROUND AGAIN.

EVEN AS I MAKE THIS REPORT, THAT DAMN MONSTER IS SHRIEKING LIKE A STEAM ENGINE AND TRYING TO TEAR ITS WAY FREE.

I HOPE WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING, BRINGING THAT THING ABOARD. IF IT GETS FREE INSIDE THE SHIP, CAPTAIN, WELL... I JUST DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

RETURNING TO SHIP.

     ---- REPORT FROM SURFACE ----

WE HAVE ONCE AGAIN CAPTURED THE HIDEOUS BEAST. THANKFULLY, WE WERE MUCH BETTER EQUIPPED FOR IT THIS TIME. 

STILL IT WAS QUITE THE LONG ORDEAL. IT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE DISTRACTED THIS TIME AROUND. UPON FURTHER 

INSPECTION, IT APPEARS IT HAD WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE ADMIRAL STUCK IN ITS TEETH. IF IT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE, 

I AM REQUESTING TO GET THIS THING AWAY FROM US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CAPTAIN.
